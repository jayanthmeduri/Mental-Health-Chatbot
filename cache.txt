User: i am feeling a bit low
Gemini: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling low. It takes courage to acknowledge that, so thank you for sharing that with me. Would you like to tell me a little more about what's making you feel this way? Even just a few details can sometimes help. Remember, I'm here to listen without judgment, and we can explore some ways to feel a little better together. No pressure at all, though. Just let me know what feels right for you.
